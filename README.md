# Email Spam Detection

This project is an email spam detection system using machine learning.

## Description

This system uses a Logistic Regression model to classify emails as spam or ham. The model is trained on a dataset of emails and their corresponding labels. The system achieves an accuracy of approximately 98% on the test set.


## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
2. Install the required libraries:
3. Download the NLTK stopwords:
4. Run the code in a Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
5. The model will be trained and evaluated. The accuracy scores will be printed to the console.
6. You can also use the model to predict the label of a new email.


## Data

The dataset used in this project is the `mail_data.csv` file. It contains a list of emails and their corresponding labels (spam or ham).


## Model

The model used in this project is a Logistic Regression model. The model is trained using the TF-IDF vectorization technique.


## Evaluation

The model is evaluated using the accuracy score. The accuracy score is the percentage of correctly classified emails. The model achieves an accuracy of approximately 98% on the test set.
